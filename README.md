Edurate is a professor evaluation program written to help professors gather information throuout the sementer in order to help them
better their courses as see where their students are struggeling. Users need only send out questionairs and, once subbmitted, Edurate
will read in the text files and output information on where students are struggeling. Edurate will save and time stamp questionairs so
that each time it is run during a given semester improvment can be seen.
